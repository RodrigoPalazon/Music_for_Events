                                Quartet With A Twist (QWAT) is a string quartet based in Amsterdam, 
                                The Netherlands, comprised of conservatory students from around the country.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Forming in 2020, the quartet saw a gap in the market for specialised live 
                                event and wedding music and, since it’s success from it’s origination in Perth, 
                                Western Australia, decided to bring that knowledge across the globe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The ‘Twist’ in QWAT’s name stands for their unique instrumentation – instead of 
                                the standard two violins,viola and cello, the cello has been replaced with a double bass! 
                                As a result, QWAT’s sound is unique and sets them apart from other string quartets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With their fun personalities and high calibre of musicianship, Quartet With A Twist has 
                                got you covered for your next event!

                                The idea to put together the two worlds; the Early Music world and the Jazz world
                                meaning not necessarily Jazz itself more the way to approach music from an oral
                                tradition rather than the written approach that governs Early Music.

                                In this ensemble the repertoire consists of postcolonial Ecuadorian folkloric dances such
                                as the "Pasillos, Albazos and Jumbos", Brazilian Chôros by Pixinguinha, traditional
                                Japanese music for "Koto (floor stringed instrument) and Shakuhachi (flute)" , music
                                from French Baroque composers such as Jean-Philippe Rameau, François Francoeur and
                                music by Johann Sebastian Bach arranged for violin and double bass.

                                The ensemble Eudora Quartet, based in The Netherlands, is composed by four young string players 
                                from Turkey and Spain. The strange year 2020 brought them together to fight for gender equality 
                                in music, and to advance their particular vision about repertoire for string quartet.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During the history of music, female composers have been relegated to a secondary position within 
                                society. Even taking into account their high level of musical education and skill, it was common 
                                for women to have their compositions credited to other male artists. Very often have women worked 
                                behind for big names, doing important tasks within the career of a father, a brother or a husband, 
                                while those male artists were taking all the public merits. These women were always under wraps, 
                                and in many cases, once they were married, their fabulous musical skills were even more underrated 
                                or simply discontinued.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Eudora Quartet wants to put the work of women where it belongs: in the concert hall. 
                                The public of our generation needs to listen to these precious pieces of art to begin 
                                healing the mistakes and injustices of the past.
